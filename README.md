Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Senior Front-end Engineer with over 12 years of experience in the technology field. I have developed a passion for creating and improving web and mobile applications, using cutting-edge tools and frameworks like ReactJS, Typescript, NextJS and Jest. I hold JavaScript certifications from Alura Cursos Online and Udemy, and I'm currently studying NodeJS at Rocketseat. Additionally, I received in-person training in advanced HTML5 and CSS3, through a course offered by an Adobe Certified Partner. I'm always training myself and learning new resources, as I recently received training in GraphQL and Docker courses, for example.

As a Front-end Software Engineer, I have worked on several projects for clients in different industries, such as healthcare, automotive, and banking. Some of the projects I am most proud of include Unimed, Volvo and Next. In these projects, I applied my skills in UI development, BDD, microfrontends, design systems, performance optimization, acessibility, and many other requirements as well as my communication and collaboration abilities. My goal is to provide valuable solutions that effectively address relevant business challenges and enhance user experience.
