Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Front-end Engineer with over 12 years of experience in technology. I specialize in developing and enhancing web and mobile applications using cutting-edge tools like ReactJS, TypeScript, NextJS, and Jest. My solid foundation in HTML5 and CSS3 is complemented by JavaScript certifications from Alura and Udemy. Currently, I'm deepening my NodeJS skills at Rocketseat and have recently expanded my expertise with training in GraphQL and Docker.

Throughout my career, I've mastered the entire front-end domain, working on diverse projects in sectors like healthcare, automotive, educational and banking for clients such as Levante, Unimed, Volvo, and Next. My focus areas include UI development, TDD/BDD, microfrontends, design systems, performance optimization, and accessibility. I am committed to delivering solutions that effectively tackle business challenges and significantly enhance user experience.
