Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Senior Front-end Engineer at H Digital, a digital modern software engineering consultancy. With over 12 years of experience in the technology field, I have developed a passion for creating and improving web and mobile applications, using cutting-edge tools and frameworks such as ReactJS, Typescript, and NextJS. I hold JavaScript certifications from Alura Cursos Online and Udemy, and I'm currently studying NodeJS at Rocketseat. Additionally, I received in-person training in advanced HTML5 and CSS3, through a course offered by an Adobe Certified Partner.

As an UI developer and consultant, I have worked on several projects for clients in different industries, such as healthcare, automotive, and banking. Some of the projects I am most proud of include Unimed Healthcare, Volvo Group, and Banco Next. In these projects, I applied my skills in UI development, BDD, microfrontends, design systems, and performance optimization, as well as my communication and collaboration abilities. My goal is to provide valuable solutions that effectively address relevant business challenges and enhance user experience.
