Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Web Engineer with around 15 years of experience in technology, specializing in building and improving web applications using modern tools like ReactJS, VueJS, TypeScript, NextJS, Cypress, and Jest. I have a strong foundation in HTML5 and CSS3, backed by JavaScript certifications from Alura and Udemy. Currently, Iâ€™m deepening my skills in JavaScript and NodeJS through Rocketseat, and recently expanded my expertise with training in GraphQL and Docker.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked across the full front-end spectrum on diverse projects in industries such as healthcare, automotive, education, and banking â€” serving clients like Levante, Unimed, Volvo, and Next. My key focus areas include UI development, TDD/BDD, microfrontends, design systems, performance optimization, and accessibility. I'm driven to deliver solutions that not only address complex business needs but also elevate user experience.
