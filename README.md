Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Senior Front-end Engineer with over 12 years of tech experience. I've crafted web and mobile apps using the latest in ReactJS, TypeScript, NextJS, Jest, and more. Iâ€™m certified in JavaScript by Alura and Udemy, and currently diving into NodeJS with Rocketseat. My skills extend to advanced HTML5 and CSS3, and Iâ€™ve recently upskilled in GraphQL and Docker too.

I've contributed to diverse projects in healthcare, automotive, educational and banking for clients like Levante, Unimed, Volvo, and Banco Next, focusing on UI development, BDD, microfrontends, design systems, performance optimization, and accessibility. My goal? Deliver solutions that tackle business challenges and elevate the user experience.
